# Digital Asset Management (DAM) App
The Digital Asset Management (DAM) app is a full-stack web application developed using Streamlit. It empowers users to manage and manipulate digital images efficiently. The app offers a range of features, including image transformation, AI-powered image analysis, image resizing with AI analysis, built in drawing canvas and image optimization and also store all the changes made in the images as logs in the backend so that the user can go back and see changes, revert back to a particular unedited picture, for collabaration it can be helpful to see who did what changes and many more4 uses of logging the editing of images.

# Features
Image Transformation: Users can perform various image transformations, including cropping, rotating, applying focal points, enhancing brightness, overlaying images, and adding frames.

AI Analysis and Tagging: The app utilizes the CLIP model to analyze uploaded images and generate relevant tags based on their content, making image searching and organization easier.

Image Resize with AI Analysis: Users can resize images while preserving essential details. The AI analysis ensures that the resized images maintain their content integrity and quality.

Image Optimization: The app offers image optimization techniques, such as format conversion and compression, to enhance image performance and loading speed.

Drawing Canvas: Explore your creativity with a built-in drawing tool.

# Tech Stack
The app is built using the following technologies:

Streamlit: For the web application framework and user interface.
PyTorch and torchvision: For image processing and transformations.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): For image handling and manipulation.
Hugging Face Transformers: For utilizing the CLIP model for AI analysis.
OpenAI: For integrating the OpenAI GPT-2 model for image caption generation.
HTML,CSS,Javascript: For generating built in drawing canvas.
MongoDB: For storing generated captions and image tags.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
'''git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dam-app.git'''
cd dam-app
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the OpenAI API key:
Replace <APIKEY> in the main.py file with your actual OpenAI API key.

Set up MongoDB connection:
Replace the MongoDB connection string in the main.py file with your MongoDB connection string.

# How to Use
Ensure you have activated the virtual environment (if created) using:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
The app will launch in your browser. Use the sidebar to select the desired function (Image Transformation, AI Analysis, Image Resize, or Image Optimization) and follow the on-screen instructions to upload and manipulate images.

For AI Analysis and Image Captioning, make sure to provide the necessary API key and model authorization in the code.
